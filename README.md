## GDF15 antagonism limits severe heart failure and prevents cardiac cachexia in mice
Heart failure and associated cachexia is an unresolved and important problem. We report a new model of severe heart failure that consistently results in cachexia. Mice lacking the ER stress induced eIF2ÔÅ° phosphatase, PPP1R15A, exhibit a dilated cardiomyopathy and severe weight loss following irradiation, whilst wildtype mice are unaffected. This is associated with increased expression of Gdf15 in the heart and increased levels of GDF15 in the circulation. We provide evidence that blockade of GDF15 activity prevents cachexia and slows the progression of heart failure. Our data suggests that cardiac stress mediates a GDF15 dependent pathway that drives weight loss and worsens cardiac function. We show relevance of GDF15 to lean mass and protein intake with patients with heart failure. Blockade of GDF15 could constitute a novel therapeutic option to limit cardiac cachexia and improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe systolic heart failure.
